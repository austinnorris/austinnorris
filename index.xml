      <description>This will be a space for me to document various things I&amp;rsquo;m working on or learning and perhaps the occasional navel-gazing insight. You can find more about me here.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer and systems administrator currently working at the UCLA Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences. I help with various satellite research missions studying space weather phenomena. I got my start working on the Electron Losses and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) mission as an undergraduate student, and now have the opportunity to mentor current student members of the project. I&amp;rsquo;ve started this blog to document some things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned or worked on, random musings on software engineering and IT, or whatever else might be interesting.</description>
